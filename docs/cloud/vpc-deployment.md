# VPC Deployment

Deploy cloud resources into your own isolated virtual network. These cloud resources — also known as _logical instances_ — fall into three categories.

- Compute: Virtual server instances (VSIs, also known as virtual servers) are presented to the user as virtual CPUs (vCPUs) with a predetermined amount of computing power, memory, etc.

- Storage: VPC customers are typically allocated a certain block storage quota per account, with the ability to purchase more. It is akin to purchasing additional hard drive space. Recommendations for storage are based on the nature of your workload.

Networking: You can deploy virtual versions of various networking functions into your virtual private cloud account to enable or restrict access to its resources. These include

- **Public gateways** deployed so that all or some areas of your VPC environment can be made available on the public-facing Internet
- **Load balancers** distribute traffic across multiple VSIs to optimize availability and performance
- **Routers** direct traffic and enable communication between network segments. 
- **Direct or dedicated links** enable rapid and secure communications between your on-premises enterprise IT environment or your private cloud and your VPC resources on public cloud.
