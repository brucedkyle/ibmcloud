# Application modernization on Z mainframe

Organizations continue to rely on core applications and data on IBM Z. Transaction and batch programs contain business logic to maintain data integrity across business entities and to implement business policies, processes, and rules. An environment of optimized applications manages the overall lifecycle of this critical business data. Data that is generated or updated by one application is taken as input by a downstream application, which might in turn create or update more data.

    Modernize applications faster with less cost and risk by using hybrid cloud
    
    A hybrid cloud transformation that integrates IBM Z can extend beyond two and a half times the value of a public cloud alone

In this article, learn the ways IBM recommends steps partners can take to drive your customers' application modernization. And learn the business reasons that can drive your customer modernization efforts.

## Business drivers

Growth in value is driven by key areas of differentiation on IBM Z:

- Increased access to core business applications and data for broader enterprise use for AI, analytics, and new customer experience applications.
- More cost-effective options for application modernization compared to the application migration, emulation, and rewrite approach that some public cloud providers take. 

!!! key

    The IBM approach uses industry standard tools and includes an operating model shift that embraces enterprise-wide tooling to significantly improve ROI with less overall risk to business.

## Fit for purpose &dash; modernization

Enterprises want to deliver digital innovation without sacrificing performance, resilience, or security.

!!! quote

    _Fit for purpose_ alignment of workloads around IBM zSystems is what we call _modernization_

Choosing the right platform based on workload requirements is critical first step to modernization. 

IBM zSystems delivers scalability and availability required for core business. Cloud brings innovation for digital channels and analytics for business insights.

The following illustration illustrates workloads and fit-for-purpose platforms.

## Why IBM Cloud

Here's a sample of differentiators of IBM Cloud for Z over other hyperscalers:

### Enterprise DevOps

- IBM Cloud is the only vendor who provides z/OS virtual servers running on native hardware
- Deploy new z/OS dev-test virtual servers in six minutes
- 15x performant as compared to emulated solutions of other public clouds

For more information, see [DevOps for Z](./devops.md).

### Secure enterprise workloads

- Only hyperscaler with FIPS 140-2 Level 4 Certification
- Secure clouds like HPCS, UKO, SCC
- Secure operating environments (Hyper Protect Virtual Servers) providing data security at rest, in transit, and in memory through proven IBM zSystems technologies

For more information, see [Security for Z](./security.md).

### Sustainable computing

- IBM LinuxONE consume half the energy compared to x86 for the same workload
- Average of 10:1 consolidation of cores for the same workloads

For more information, see [Sustainability for Z](./sustainability.md).

### Integration with cloud native application

- Direct integration and support for IBM Cloud Paks and Red Hat OpenShift running on IBM LinuxONE offerings and in co=location models
- Native IBM zSystems security can be expanded across the enterprise
- Wealth of experience and patters with IBM partners
