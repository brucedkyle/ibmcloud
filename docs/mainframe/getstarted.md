## Hands-on mainframe learning

You’ll be communicating directly with a Logical Partition (LPAR) on one of the z15 machines. In other words, you get a piece of a z15 all to yourself. We want you to be able to learn as much as you want to on this platform, and you deserve to play on a real system.

You will use VS Code, an extensible editor made by Microsoft, to communicate with the mainframe. However, you can use APIs, custom apps, and terminals as another option as well. The software is available for Mac, Windows, and Linux. 

See [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/requirements) for your development system requirements.
