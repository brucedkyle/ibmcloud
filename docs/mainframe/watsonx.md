**watsonx Code Assistant for Z** is a new generative AI-assisted product that will help enable faster translation of COBOL to Java on IBM Z and enhances developer productivity on the platform. 

### watsonx Code Assistant use cases

- [Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed](https://www.redhat.com/en/engage/ansible-lightspeed). IBM watsonx Code Assistant for Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed enables developers of all skill levels to write Ansible playbooks with AI-generated recommendations. Purpose-built to accelerate IT Automation, the service will deliver automation content recommendations that are written in YAML code, and adhere to accepted best practices, for an enhanced Ansible experience users can be confident in.
- [IBM Z Application Modernization](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/ibmz-and-linuxone/blogs/kyle-charlet/2023/08/22/harnessing-generative-ai-for-modernization). IBM watsonx Code Assistant for Z is an end-to-end AI-assisted mainframe application modernization solution that will make it easier for developers to incrementally modernize COBOL business services and selectively convert to high-quality Java code. With watsonx Code Assistant for Z, clients will be able to leverage generative AI and automated tooling to accelerate their mainframe application modernization journey â€“while addressing key challenges around developer skills and time to value.

## Code model

These solutions are powered by [IBM's watsonx.ai code model](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai?_gl=1*o2ibgs*_ga*MjcxNzQwMjkzLjE2OTUzOTg4MjM.*_ga_FYECCCS21D*MTY5NTY1MjU0Mi40LjEuMTY5NTY1NDAwNS4wLjAuMA..), which will have knowledge of 115 coding languages1 having learned from 1.5 trillion tokens.2 At 20 billion parameters, it is on target to become one of the largest generative AI foundation models for code automation.3 

The watsonx Code Assistant product portfolio will extend over time to address other programming languages, to improve time to value for modernization and address growing skills challenges for developers.
