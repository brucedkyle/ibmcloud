# VMware on IBM Cloud

Seamlessly migrate and modernize VMware workloads to the cloud **IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions**. Leverage your existing investments for a consistent VMware experience—retaining the same level of access, security and control. 

You can manage it yourself or having IBM manage it for you.

## Key challenges

!!! key "Challenges and solution"

    - **Extend, migrate and scale**. Easily extend your on-premises data center to address capacity expansion, on-demand app scaling, and accelerating cloud migrations of vSphere workloads to IBM Cloud—without re-architecting applications and while reducing migration complexity. See more about [deploying new or existing workloads](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/smartpapers/vmware-workloads).
    - **Cyber resiliency and recovery**. IBM Cloud’s Cyber Resiliency and Recovery solution provides a simplified business continuity plan with cost-effective disaster recovery (DR), Cloud backup, and a robust ransomware recovery solution to protect and restore your data across your IT environment. See [IBM Cloud Cyber Recovery Solutions](https://www.ibm.com/cyber-recovery).
    - **Cloud VDI (DaaS)**. Build your VDI or DaaS environment on IBM Cloud to deliver an enhanced user experience to your remote workforce and your partners, without sacrificing on security or performance. See [Desktop as a service (DaaS)](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/DXJYN50L)
    - **Application modernization**. Modernize your VMware workloads with Red Hat OpenShift and Kubernetes containers. Improve business outcomes with advanced technologies such as AI and blockchain. Integrate existing VMware-based applications into a hybrid cloud strategy. See [Application modernization](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/vmware/appmod-with-containers).
    - **Data security for regulated workloads**. This offering includes a secure-by-default architecture that follows IBM's unique policy controls framework, it provides continuous compliance monitoring, and the highest level of data encryption (FIPS 140-2 Level 4). See [VMware Regulated Workloads overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vrw-overview).
