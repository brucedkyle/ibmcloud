## IBM Open Enterprise SDK for Python

[IBM Open Enterprise SDK for Python](https://www.ibm.com/products/open-enterprise-python-zos) is a Python compiler and interpreter for IBM z/OS®.

Use it to modernize your critical applications by developing APIs, plugins and wrappers to extend business critical applications for faster delivery.

Build new and efficient, or modernize applications using no-charge license Python running on z/OS.

Integrate AI/ML for advanced data analysis.

Access to the Python Standard Library provides you with an extensive set of functions that can save development resources and reduce costs when creating applications. The library includes highly used programming tasks in areas like string operations, cryptology, threading, networking, internet and web service tools, operating system interfaces, and protocols. Developers can make use of these modules to fulfill common application tasks, allowing them to concentrate on implementing business functions while writing fewer lines of code.

### Try it

This free edition provides a secure and efficient approach to experience the benefits of the popular Python language, and develop new applications the same way you would on any other platform.

### Python AI Toolkit

Python AI Toolkit for IBM z/OS is a library of relevant open source software to support today's artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) workloads. It is a collection of Python packages that can be installed and managed using Package Installer for Python (pip), the common Python package manager. These packages are provided to pip from an IBM-hosted PyPi-style repository, leveraging supply chain security, that makes your software management experience common across your Python environments.

See [Python® AI Toolkit for IBM® z/OS®](https://ibm-z-oss-oda.github.io/python_ai_toolkit_zos/) on GitHub.
