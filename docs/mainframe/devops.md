# A modern DevOps platform for mainframe applications with IBM Cloud

Deliver new business functions and changes to the existing functions at cloud scale. Enterprises are adopting secure DevOps and GitOps practices embracing Open Source tools and standard processes to help development, test and operations teams work together while modernizing the workloads.

## DevOps business drivers

IBM zSystems becomes just another platform for an organization adopting DevOps across the enterprise. 

By incorporating common tools and processes based on open-source technologies you:

- Address key requirement for enterprises to lower the entry barrier for developers on zSystems
- Support new graduates and cloud developers to work on IBM zSystem seamlessly.
- Align mainframe development practices with cloud development processes and delivery cycles.

## DevOps technology solution

The solution integrates CI/CD pipelines spanning x86 and z/OS compute infrastructure available in IBM Cloud. Developers can build innovative solutions and test them on respective infrastructure and deliver changes faster with confidence.

Key components of the system include: 

- IBM zSystems supports the latest development, operational tools and processes and features z/OS dev and test through [IBM Wazi as a Service](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/wazi-as-a-service). 
- IBM Cloud offers a fully functional mainframe through a high-performing IBM Z compute Virtual Server Instance (VSI) in [IBM Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/vpc) that can be integrated with modern DevOps toolchains with built-in security and compliance features. 
- Open Source tool chain, familiar to cloud developers.

!!! key "Key value to the business"

    - The solution helps remove skills barriers, eliminates contention between multiple teams sharing on-premises-based IBM Z LPAR and spurs innovation in mainframe application development and test processes.
    - Takes advantage of many cloud services—like data and [AI](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/what-is-artificial-intelligence)—to modernize mainframe applications. 
    - Security and compliance services available in IBM Cloud can protect and validate mainframe applications and data during the development phase.

Enterprise DevOps solution architectures can be implemented on IBM Cloud to help set up an integrated DevOps pipeline suitable for both cloud-native distributed and mainframe applications. They can 

!!! value "Key value to developers"

    - Get started with a z/OS dev and test virtual server on IBM Cloud in under six minutes.
    - Enable continuous testing with an IBM zSystem in IBM Cloud that performs up to 15x faster.

## Create the pipeline

Runs on Red Hat OpenShift. After you validate the modified code and debug it in the IDE, the CI/CD pipeline takes the committed code. Then, the CI/CD pipeline automatically builds, tests, qualifies, and deploys the code to the target z/OS system.

See [Creating a CI/CD pipeline for z/OS applications](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/wdfrhcw/1.4.0?topic=creating-cicd-pipeline-zos-applications).
