# IBM Cloud VPC Solutions

IBM Cloud® Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a highly resilient and highly secure software-defined network (SDN) on which you can build isolated private clouds for your business operations while maintaining essential public cloud benefits. 

Choose your compute, storage and networking resources and we’ll provide maximum availability and scalability, plus a variety of cost-effective options for your workload demands. Such as:

- [Virtual Servers](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/virtual-servers)
- [Hyper Protect Virtual Servers](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/hyper-protect-virtual-servers)
- [Bare Metal Servers](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/bare-metal-servers/vpc)
- [Block Storage](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/block-storage)
- [File Storage](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/file-storage)
- [Object Storage](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/object-storage)
- [Load Balancers](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/load-balancer)
- [Direct Link](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/direct-link)

!!! key "Key features"

    Use a VPC to manage network services and to start instances as needed to support your mission-critical, cloud-tolerant, and cloud-native applications. The key features of a VPC are as follows:

    - Create and manage isolated application environments through an API
    - Define your own networking policies that are designed for security and convenient access
    - Design network topologies with bring your own IP (BYOIP)
    - Provision your resources and connect them to each other or isolate them from one another
    - Cover multiple regions for disaster recovery and resilience
    - Use availability zones that allow high-speed and low-latency connections across regions, with high availability
    - Use high-speed networking and storage devices
    - Allow always-on services (control plane)
    - Provide and use core services: Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM), virtual private network (VPN), firewalls, Secure Shell (SSH), domain name servers (DNS), and L4 load balancing
