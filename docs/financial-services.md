# IBM Cloud for Financial Services

**IBM Cloud for Financial Services®** is designed to help clients mitigate risk and accelerate cloud adoption for even their most sensitive workloads. Security and controls are built into the platform to enable financial institutions to automate their security and compliance posture, and make it easier for clients to simplify their risk management and demonstrate regulatory compliance postures.

## What it is

The IBM Cloud for Financial Services is a platform and ecosystem program designed to enable financial institutions and their partners to confidently host applications and workloads in the public cloud. IBM Cloud for Financial Services is not a separate cloud from IBM’s public cloud offering, but a platform and set of capabilities IBM has implemented on IBM Cloud on a framework of security and compliance that enables financial institutions to move to the cloud with confidence. 

IBM Cloud for Financial Services is comprised of IBM Cloud catalog services and [ISV applications]
(https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog?search=label%3Asupport_third_party) that comply with the IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services. All products and services offered through IBM Cloud for Financial Services must be from validated sources. Only ISVs, SaaS providers, and other vendors that have demonstrated compliance with the IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services are eligible to deliver their offerings through IBM Cloud for Financial Services.
