# Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud

**Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud** is a managed offering to create your own Red Hat OpenShift cluster of compute hosts to deploy and manage containerized apps on IBM Cloud. Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud provides intelligent scheduling, self-healing, horizontal scaling, service discovery and load balancing, automated rollouts and rollbacks, and secret and configuration management for your apps. Combined with an intuitive user experience, built-in security and isolation, and advanced tools to secure, manage, and monitor your cluster workloads, you can rapidly deliver highly available and secure containerized apps in the public cloud.

!!! info "Top use cases"

    - **Build and run cloud native applications**. Foster innovation within your organization by providing tooling and support enabling teams to deliver code with an automated and secure CI/CD toolchain.
    - **Modernizing existing applications**. Extend your applications efficiency and capability by packaging as containers or refactor to microservices with a cloud native approach.
    - **Solving the challenges of multi-cloud**. Containers package the complete application and its dependencies as one entity, allowing a consistent deployment model across OpenShift environments.
    - **Development and Testing**. Leverage cloud capabilities to quickly setup and tear down environments on demand.

As you look at the various use cases, you  see workload themes, such as one of the following areas.

- AI and machine learning
- Data and storage
- DevOps
- Identity management

## Features

!!! Quote

    Opinionated Kubernetes management. Fully automated. As-a-service.

- **Provisioning**. Automated provisioning and configuration of infrastructure (compute, network and storage), and installation and configuration of OpenShift.
- **Deployment**. Automatic multizone deployment in MZRs, including integration with CIS to execute cross-zone traffic routing.
- **Configuration**. Automatic scaling, backups and failure recovery for OpenShift configurations, components and worker nodes.
- **Lifecycle**. Automatic upgrades of all components (operating system, OpenShift components, cluster services) and performance tuning and security hardening.
- **Support**. 24x7 global SRE team maintenance of the health of the environment, with the team using its OpenShift and Kubernetes expertise to reach faster problem resolution.
- **Security**. Built-in security, including image signing, image deployment enforcement, hardware trust, security patch management, and automatic compliance (HIPAA, PCI, SOC2, ISO).

## Host infrastrcutures

Red Hat® OpenShift® on IBM Cloud is a fully managed OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) (link resides outside ibm.com). Your compute hosts cluster can run on

- [IBM Cloud Virtual Servers](https://www.ibm.com/products/virtual-servers)
- [IBM Cloud Bare Metal Servers](https://www.ibm.com/products/bare-metal-servers)
- On your own hardware or third-party cloud using [IBM Cloud Satellite](https://www.ibm.com/products/satellite).

With Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud, OpenShift developers have a fast and secure way to containerize and deploy enterprise workloads in Kubernetes clusters. Because IBM manages OCP, you’ll have more time to focus on your core tasks.
