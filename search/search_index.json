When the API gateway receives a request, it checks to see whether it is an authorized request.

The z/OS  Connect EE server transforms a REST- or JSON-based API request into a payload according to the specified copybook format.

The IBM foundation models use a large, curated set of enterprise data backed by a robust filtering and cleansing process and auditable data lineage. These models are being trained not just on language, but on a variety of modalities, including code, time-series data, tabular data, geospatial data, and IT events data. </p> <p>Examples of model categories include:</p> <ul> <li>fm.code: Models built to automatically generate code for developers through a natural-language interface to boost developer productivity and enable the automation of many IT tasks.</li> <li>fm.NLP: A collection of large language models (LLMs) for specific or industry-specific domains that utilize curated data where bias can be mitigated more easily and can be quickly customized using client data.</li> <li>fm.geospatial: Model built on climate and remote sensing data to help organizations understand and plan for changes in natural disaster patterns, biodiversity, land use, and other geophysical processes that could impact their businesses.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"watsonx/watsonxai/#watsonai-internal-architecture","title":"watson.ai internal architecture","text":"<p>Reference: https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCf2fm239G3dBGHRcf9BWXCh7PWG</p>"},{"location":"watsonx/watsonxai/#traditional-ai","title":"Traditional AI","text":"<p>The traditional, non-foundational ML models supported in Watson Studio today will also be supported in watsonx.

Foundation models are different. While there is an opportunity to use tools, guides, and automation while building FMs, it will look different than the \u201cexploration style\u201d using Auto AI. For example, while building FMs, data cleaning and filtering are essential. The tools that automate and optimize this at scale are major accelerators. </p> <p>We\u2019re in the early days of understanding which model architectures best fit different problems. There may be an opportunity for automation and model customization i.e. how we customize a base model for the task(s) needed. Right now, it depends on the user knowing what data to provide, how to configure the tuning, and which base model to select. The steps in the process could lend itself well to automated tuning.</p>"},{"location":"watsonx/watsonxai/#getting-started","title":"Getting started","text":"<p>You can provision IBM\u00ae Cloud service instances for the watsonx platform.</p> <p>The IBM watsonx.ai component provides the following services that provide key functionality, including tools and compute resources:</p> <ul> <li>Watson\u2122 Studio</li> <li>Watson Machine Learning</li> </ul> <p>See IBM Cloud services in the IBM watsonx services catalog</p>"},{"location":"watsonx/watsonxai/#set-up-your-service","title":"Set up your service","text":"<p>See:</p> <ul> <li>Getting started with IBM watsonx as a Service</li> <li>Quick start tutorials.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"watsonx/watsonxai/#preparing-data","title":"Preparing data","text":"<ul> <li>Refine data</li> <li>Generate synthetic tabular data</li> </ul>"},{"location":"watsonx/watsonxai/#analyzing-and-visualizing-data","title":"Analyzing and visualizing data","text":"<ul> <li>Notebooks</li> <li>Analyze data in a Jupyter notebook</li> </ul>"},{"location":"watsonx/watsonxai/#building-deploying-and-trusting-models","title":"Building, deploying and trusting models","text":"<ul> <li>Analyzing data and building models</li> <li>Deploying and managing models</li> </ul> <p>Tutorials:</p> <ul> <li>Buid a model with AutoAI</li> <li>Build a model with Jupyter notebook</li> <li>Build a model with SPSS Modeler</li> <li>Build a decision optimization model</li> <li>Automate the lifecycle of a model with pipelines</li> </ul>"},{"location":"watsonx/watsonxai/#prompting-a-foundation-model","title":"Prompting a foundation model","text":"<ul> <li>Retrieval-augmented generation pattern</li> <li>Prompt Lab</li> <li>Foundation models</li> </ul> <p>Tutorials:</p> <ul> <li>Prompt a foundation model</li> <li>Prompt a foundation model with the retrieval-argumented generation pattern</li> <li> <p>Tune a foundation model</p> </li> <li> <p>Evaluate and trace a prompt template</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"watsonx/watsonxai/#references","title":"References","text":"<ul> <li>watsonx.ai</li> <li>Getting started code</li> <li>White paper Train, validate, tune and deploy AI models</li> <li>IBM watsonx.ai: Open source, pre-trained foundation models make AI and automation easier than ever before</li> </ul>"},{"location":"watsonx/watsonxai/#ibm-partners","title":"IBM Partners","text":"<ul> <li>See watsonx.ai Sales Kit</li> <li>Set up demo with customer.
