# Application modernization on Z mainframe

Organizations continue to rely on core applications and data on IBM Z. Transaction and batch programs contain business logic to maintain data integrity across business entities and to implement business policies, processes, and rules. An environment of optimized applications manages the overall lifecycle of this critical business data. Data that is generated or updated by one application is taken as input by a downstream application, which might in turn create or update more data.

!!! Key

    The need for transformation places significant demands on existing applications and data, which necessitates modernization and integration. No wonder CEOs ranked **Tech Modernization** as a top priority for their organizations in 2023. &dash; _[IBM IBV 2023 CEO study](https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/c-suite-study/ceo)_

    67% of executives say the mainframe-based applications in their organizations need to be modernized. &dash; _IBM IBV 2023 Mainframe executive pulse survey_

    Modernize applications faster with less cost and risk by using hybrid cloud.
    
    A hybrid cloud transformation that integrates IBM Z can extend beyond two and a half times the value of a public cloud alone.

- Ways IBM recommends steps partners can take to drive your customers' application modernization. 
- The business reasons that can drive your customer modernization efforts.
- Scenerios that support your business and the steps you can take for scenarios you select.
- Training materials to get started in your application migration efforts.

## Modernization strategy

In a recent IBM Institute for Business Value study, 71% of executives say mainframe-based applications are central to their business strategy[^1]. Four out of five respondents say their organizations need to rapidly transform to keep up with competition, which includes modernizing mainframe-based apps and adopting a more open approach. The report confirms that executives view modernizing mainframe-based applications — and connecting them with new applications through a hybrid cloud environment — as crucial to driving a holistic digital transformation strategy across the mainframe and cloud.

## Business-aligned continuous approach

IBM recommends a business-aligned continuous approach to application modernization that allows businesses to build on existing investments, targeting only required application changes. Why rewrite 100% of your entire application portfolio if only 20% needs to be modernized? IBM’s approach starts by building on your current foundation.

Optimize [hardware and software costs](https://www.ibm.com/it-infrastructure/z/pricing-tailored-fit) while streamlining application performance and management. By integrating IBM Z into a [hybrid cloud platform](https://www.ibm.com/hybrid-cloud) to fully leverage [cloud-native](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/cloud-native) development, you’ll unlock additional revenue by increasing access to mainframe data for analytics and [AI](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/what-is-artificial-intelligence) through an API and data-modernization strategy.

As a result, you’re more empowered to increase business agility by moving from a [waterfall development](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/agile-vs-waterfall) to an [enterprise DevOps](https://www.ibm.com/z/devops) process and an automated continuous [CI/CD pipeline](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/ci-cd-pipeline) that is fully aligned to business priorities and is open and standard across the business, allowing for greater sharing of tools, skills and expertise.

And finally, reduce time-to-value with proven [application modernization patterns](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture/architectures/application-modernization-mainframe/patterns), acceleration tools and best practices that include prescriptive “how-to” guides and showcases for modernizing and deploying on IBM z/OS and zLinux, IBM LinuxONE and public clouds together.

## Business drivers

Growth in value is driven by key areas of differentiation on IBM Z:

- Increased access to core business applications and data for broader enterprise use for AI, analytics, and new customer experience applications.
- More cost-effective options for application modernization compared to the application migration, emulation, and rewrite approach that some public cloud providers take. 

!!! key

    The IBM approach uses industry standard tools and includes an operating model shift that embraces enterprise-wide tooling to significantly improve ROI with less overall risk to business.

!!! important

    In a study by the IBM Institute of Business Value: 
    
    We found that most executives know where their modernization programs need to go and are charting a course to get there &dash; but only a few have really put the wheels in motion. Only 27% say their organization has modernized many of the necessary workflows, including the related applications, data, and systems.

    Leaders are focused on operational objectives and incremental improvements, rather than the strategic outcomes that will allow you to thrive in the business landscape of tomorrow.

## Action guide

The IBM Institute of Business value recommends the following steps:

1. **Adopt an iterative approach**. As part of your plan to integrate new and existing environments, factor in your industry and workload attributes. Partner with your business counterparts to co-create a business case and a “best-fit” roadmap designed to meet your strategic goals. Adopt an incremental and continuous approach to modernization instead of a big bang rip and replace. 
2. **Assess your portfolio and build your roadmap**. Examine the capabilities that define the role of the mainframe in your enterprise today and how those capabilities tie into the greater hybrid cloud technology ecosystem. In addition, prioritize cross-skilling within the organization and lean on your partners to make up for new or existing talent and resource gaps. 
3. **Leverage multiple application modernization entry points**. Enable easy access to existing mainframe applications and data by using APIs. Provide a common developer experience by integrating open-source tools and a streamlined process for agility. Develop cloud native applications on the mainframe and containerize applications.

## Hybrid approach

A hybrid best-fit approach that includes mainframes and cloud supports the integration and deployment of applications; which maximizes business agility and addresses client pain points.

- **Reduce the talent gap** with common tools and operating models across platforms
- **Accelerate time to market** with a consistent DevOps experience for cloud and mainframes, that includes repeatable patterns and reference architecture
- **Easily access mission-critical data** on the mainframe without moving off-platform
- **Optimize costs** with a tailored-fit-pricing  model on the mainframe

!!! quote

    "Part of our transformation was driven by the desire, and the need, to improve data-sharing across teams, so each line of business has 
the necessary information to deliver rapid support," says Jacqui Leggetter, Head of Integration (Deputy Director), DWP Digital, Department for Work and Pensions.

## Fit for purpose &dash; modernization

Enterprises want to deliver digital innovation without sacrificing performance, resilience, or security.

!!! quote

    _Fit for purpose_ alignment of workloads around IBM zSystems is what we call _modernization_.

Choosing the right platform based on workload requirements is critical first step to modernization. 

IBM zSystems delivers scalability and availability required for core business. Cloud brings innovation for digital channels and analytics for business insights.

The following illustration illustrates workloads and fit-for-purpose platforms.
