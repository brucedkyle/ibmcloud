# VMware Shared

The **IBM Cloud® for VMware Solutions Shared** offering provides standardized and customizable deployment choices of VMware® virtual data center environments. With VMware Shared virtual data centers, you can quickly and seamlessly migrate or deploy VMware workloads to the cloud, on IBM-hosted VMware infrastructure. 

IBM provides a self-service on-demand VMware cloud computing platform with **VMware Cloud Director** running on IBM Cloud. This Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) on-demand offering provides the option to use specific virtual CPU (vCPU), storage, vRAM, Network, and IP, as needed.

## Business value

IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions Shared is built around three key pillars:

- **Cost-effective scalability**. Customers pay for what they use, with the option to grow should they require additional resources over time (or need to contract to fewer resource commitments as their services find greater efficiencies). As a result, customers can minimize their unused capacity and save money. Instead of buying fixed-size virtual machines, clients can instead purchase compute capacity (as needed) and provision any number of virtual machines (of different sizes) within the capacity limit they set.
- **Temporary migration, co-location, and burst**. Multi-site data centers can be consolidated within a single location by migrating workloads from different sources.
- **Disaster recovery**. suite of pre-installed services— Veeam Availability Suite, Veeam Cloud Connect, and Zerto —provide options for disaster recover of critical workloads, achieving recovery point objectives (RPOs) within seconds, and maintaining application consistency.

!!! Key

    The offering is ideal for enterprise clients that are currently operating VMware workloads on-premises, but need to adopt cloud as part of their digital transformation and modernization strategy. The automation and added support that is made available through an IBM Cloud deployment speeds the time to delivery and lowers the risks that would otherwise be present if a client attempted to "roll their own" cloud deployment.

## Capabilities

VMware Shared has the following IaaS subscription service types:

- Multitenant on-demand virtual data centers
- Multitenant reserved virtual data centers

    - Virtual data center creation
    - Virtual data center elasticity
    - Virtual data center deletion
