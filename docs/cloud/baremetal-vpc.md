# IBM Cloud Bare Metal on VPC Infrastructure

You can provision dedicated, **Bare Metal Servers for VPC** on your own software-defined, private cloud and deploy to multizone regions. A bare metal server is ideal for expanding capacity of applications that benefit from elastic, quick provisioning, and deprovisioning. Accelerate deployment with preset server profiles for your high-performance workloads.

Choose a pre-set metal server profile and deploy to multiline regions in 10 minutes or less, across a software-defined network. Features the latest 2nd Generation Intel Xeon processor. Ideal for high-availability and maximum-elasticity demands.

You get the full suite of IBM Cloud VPC networking benefits, plus 4x faster networking throughput (up to 100 Gbps). Using a VPC for your dedicated, bare metal servers helps you isolate and provision network segments on the cloud, where you then can deploy and manage your compute, storage, and networking.
