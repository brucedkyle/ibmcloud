# Wazi Sandbox

**Wazi Sandbox** provides a web user interface that can create, and monitor images. 

You can self provision z/OS runtimes and databases and provides a fully virtual z/OS environment that enables development and testing of z/OS applications on OpenShift running on x86_64 hardware. 

Develop and test z/OS application components without requiring IBM Z hardware, then deploy the code to either the sandbox testing stage on IBM Cloud or IBM Z for production.

## Features

Sandbox provides the following features:

- An application development and testing environment that can improve development infrastructure availability and flexibility
- Current levels of IBM z/OS software that give access to new runtime capabilities for development and testing for enterprises
- Mixed workload support for enterprises, which can help reduce development costs
- An approachable and portable environment for education on Z for enterprises
- A web-based interface to extract, deploy and manage the application images from an existing Z or ADCD packages.
- Creating and managing application images from various sources.
- Provisioning application images for developers and testers in a self-service automated way.
- Monitoring the status and availability of all created assets and target environments.

## Sandbox architecture

The following diagram shows the components of Sandbox and how they work together.

Runs on Red Hat OpenShift. After setting up the subcomponents of Wazi Sandbox, you can provision a personal z/OS system on Red Hat OpenShift. When your personal z/OS system is up, you can connect to the system from the IDE.
