# Power Systems Virtual Server


## What to deploy

Power Systems Virtual Server is an IaaS offering that allows you to deploy your current IBM i, AIX and Linux workloads in a hybrid cloud environment, without refactoring. Some examples include SAP, SAP HANA, and Oracle, though other home-grown applications are supported too.

You can bring your own customized AIX or IBM i operating system (OS) image to deploy within Power Systems Virtual Server. Simply store your image on Cloud Object Storage (COS), point the Power Systems Virtual Server console to the image, and deploy the Virtual Server instance.

See [Deploying a custom image within a Power Systems Virtual Server](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-deploy-custom-image)

## Key use cases

- **Business continuity planning**. Use Power Systems Virtual Server as a reliable HA/DR destination for on-premise environments, without doubling the cost of hardware ownership. See [Case study](https://www.cidademarketing.com.br/marketing/2021/09/02/brf-conclui-plano-de-recuperacao-de-desastres-com-ibm-power-virtual-servers/).

- **Data center strategy optimization**. Provision on-demand to stay up to date with the latest software and streamlined licensing costs, without upskilling in new specialized technologies. See [case study](https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/iptor-sweden/).

- **Modernize**. Start the hybrid cloud journey with a quick, temporary sandbox environment for testing, without sacrificing mission critical uptime. See [case study](https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/fnz-uk/).

- **Operational excellence and cost optimization**. Reduce operational cost with the same Power infrastructure, performance, security and reliability; all without replatforming workloads. See [case study](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/labeyrie-fine-foods-picks-ibm-power-systems-virtual-server/).

## Get started with a dev test environment

1. **Create a workspace**. A workspace is a free working environment that acts as a folder for all your Power Systems Virtual Server resources at a specific geographic region, including compute, networking, and storage resources.

2. **Create a virtual server instance**. Deploy your first virtual server instance with the storage and network needed.
